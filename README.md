# RetailMax
E-Commerce Monolith Cloud Migration Platform

Objective:
To modernize and optimize RetailMax’s legacy e-commerce system by migrating its monolithic application architecture to a cloud-native infrastructure. The project aims to improve release efficiency, ensure application scalability, minimize downtime, and introduce automated monitoring, thereby enhancing the overall system reliability and maintainability.

Background:
RetailMax, an established online retail platform, currently relies on a manually deployed monolithic architecture. Every update—whether in the product catalog, cart, or checkout flow—requires time-consuming, error-prone processes involving manual server configuration and deployment. This leads to:
	•	Downtime during peak traffic events
	•	Delayed feature rollouts
	•	Inconsistent deployment environments
	•	Lack of real-time performance monitoring

Scope of the Project:
The solution focuses on end-to-end modernization, which includes:
	1.	Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning using Terraform for scalable and repeatable AWS resource setup (VPC, EC2/ECS).
	2.	Application Containerization using Docker to encapsulate the entire monolithic app.
	3.	CI/CD Pipeline Implementation with Jenkins, enabling automatic building, testing, and deployment from GitHub.
	4.	Server Configuration Management with Ansible to automate software setup and app deployment.
	5.	Real-time Monitoring and Visualization using Prometheus and Grafana for tracking resource usage and application interactions.

Expected Outcomes:
	•	Fully automated and repeatable cloud deployments
	•	Zero-downtime releases
	•	Improved deployment frequency and rollback safety
	•	Real-time metrics and alerting dashboards
	•	Clear documentation, Team collaboration, and DevOps pipeline demonstration
