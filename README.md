# RetailMax
E-Commerce Monolith Cloud Migration Platform

**Problem Definition:**

RetailMax, a prominent online retailer, operates a legacy monolithic e-commerce application that faces several operational and developmental challenges:
	â€¢Manual Deployments: Every update (product catalog, cart, checkout) requires manual deployment and configuration of servers, leading to delays and inconsistencies.

	â€¢Downtime During Releases: Frequent unplanned downtime during high-traffic sales events causes loss of revenue and poor customer experience.

	â€¢Slow Release Cycles: The lack of automation leads to slow, error-prone release cycles and delayed feature rollouts.

	â€¢Limited Scalability and Visibility: Their existing infrastructure lacks the ability to scale automatically and provides minimal visibility into application performance.

These issues severely impact RetailMaxâ€™s agility, reliability, and ability to compete in a fast-paced e-commerce environment.

 **Project Objective:**

To modernize RetailMaxâ€™s monolithic e-commerce platform by migrating it to the cloud and establishing an automated, resilient DevOps workflow that ensures:
	1.	Reliable Cloud Infrastructure: Provision consistent AWS infrastructure (VPC, EC2, security groups) using Terraform.
	2.	Application Portability: Containerize the monolithic application using Docker for environment consistency and portability.
	3.	Automated CI/CD: Implement a Jenkins pipeline to automate building, testing, and deployment processes to AWS.
	4.	Configuration Management: Use Ansible to automate configuration of servers and deployment of containers.
	5.	Zero-Downtime Releases: Enable blue-green or rolling deployments to ensure uninterrupted service during updates.
	6.	Performance Monitoring: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana to provide real-time monitoring and observability into application health and system resources.

Ultimately, the solution should allow faster, safer, and scalable deployments, reduce manual effort, minimize downtime, and provide actionable insightsâ€”enhancing RetailMaxâ€™s overall operational efficiency and customer experience


## Commit Attribution Note

Some commits in this repository may appear under the name `Aditya Tomar` but are not linked to my GitHub profile (`@adityatomar25`). This happened because earlier commits were made using a local Git configuration with an unregistered system email (`adityatomar@Adityas-MacBook-Air-3.local`), which GitHub does not recognize.

Going forward, all commits are properly attributed using my GitHub-linked email (`143313634+adityatomar25@users.noreply.github.com`). You can still verify authorship by checking the commit history (`git log`), where my name appears as the author.
